# Course detail >> exams
- Add submit button
- put questions into a form.

# Admin site
- left-side navigation is not intuitive.  Though the course may wish me to leave everything registered there.
- Questions view: list shows e.g. "question object (5)."  Should show question text instead.
- Question detail view: Lesson id should show lesson title.
